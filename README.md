**US Flight Delays**

I'm thrilled to share my experience from my first significant project during my Master's in Big Data Analytics. We focused on understanding flight delays using a comprehensive dataset from US airlines spanning 2011 to 2015. This project was not just about learning to manipulate large datasets but also about gaining real-world insights that could help improve airline operations and passenger experiences.

To manage the data effectively, we set up a data warehouse using a star schema. This structure centered around a main fact table that recorded details like delay times and cancellation statuses, linked to dimension tables that described airlines, airports, dates, and weather conditions. This setup allowed us to efficiently organize and query large amounts of data.

The project involved a detailed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, where we first extracted data from reliable aviation and weather databases focused on US airlines. During the transformation phase, we cleaned the data thoroughly, removing any inaccuracies and enhancing it by adding valuable details such as delay reasons and weather conditions. Finally, we loaded this cleaned and enriched data into our Hive data warehouse, which supported our complex analytical queries.

Using Tableau, we created visualizations that made it easy to identify patterns and trends. Our analysis revealed that flight delays were most common during the busy summer and winter holiday seasons, and severe weather like thunderstorms and snow were significant factors in delays, particularly affecting major airports in the northern and eastern United States. We also identified specific airlines and airports that frequently experienced delays, providing a focus for potential operational improvements.

This project has been a significant stepping stone in my data Analystics journey, providing me with invaluable insights into both data analytics and the aviation industry.
